# Melanoma-segmentation-using-deep-learning
This code proposes a novel deep learning-based, fully automated approach to skin lesion segmentation, including sophisticated pre and postprocessing approaches. We use three deep learning models, including UNet, deep residual U-Net (ResUNet), and improved ResUNet (ResUNet++).
